# This is an incredibly simplified Dark Souls 2 game. Here is how it works.
## First you will be prompted to choose a character class. Deprived is not included in this game.
### After picking, you will be shown your character's base stats.
*Upgrading your stats in this game will work differently than it does in the original game, more on that later.* 
## You will then be given your weapon. Your weapon will be determined by the class you chose. The weapon the class starts with in a new game will be your weapon throughout the entire game. The possible weapons are:  
- Broken Straight Sword **Warrior**
- Broadsword **Knight**
- Scimitar (+1) **Swordsman**
- Shortsword (+1) **Swordsman**
- Hand axe **Bandit**
- Mace **Cleric**
- Cleric's Sacred Chime **Cleric**
- Dagger **Sorcerer, Explorer**
- Sorcerer's Staff **Sorcerer**  
  
*Upgrading your weapon in this game will work differently than it does in the original game, more on that later.*
## Once you've been given your stats and weapon, you are off to face the first boss! This game will only include 10 bosses, chosen from only those required to finish the main storyline. This includes (in order):
1. Last Giant **10,000 souls**
2. Dragonrider **12,000 souls**
3. Flexile Sentry **14,000 souls**
4. Ruin Sentinel **33,000 souls**
8. Mytha, the Baneful Queen **20,000 souls**
6. Old Iron King **48,000 souls**
7. Duke's Dear Freja **42,000 souls**
8. Looking Glass Knight **25,500 souls**
9. Guardian Dragon **37,000 souls**  
10. Nashandra **Soul of Nashandra**

### You will start off with ? souls, and the only way to gain them is to defeat bosses. After each fight, you will have the option to upgrade your stats and weapon.

## Upgrading
### You can upgrade each stat individually. You will be prompted to select a stat. This will show you how many souls it would take to upgrade, and ask you if you want to upgrade it.
