# Creating a comment
print("Hello, World!") # Comments can be placed at the end of a line, and Python will ignore the rest of the line
# A comment does not have to be text that explains the code, it can also be used to prevent Python from executing code
# print("Hello, World!")
print("Cheers, Mate!")

# Multiline comments
# This is a comment
# written in
# more than just one line
# Since Python will ignore string literals that are not assigned to a variable, you can add a multiline string (triple quotes) in your code, and place your comment inside it:
"""
This is a comment
written in
more than just one line
"""
# As long as the string is not assigned to a variable, Python will read the code, but then ignore it, and you have made a multiline comment
